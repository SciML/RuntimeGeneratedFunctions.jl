module RGFPrecompConsumerTest
    # This module is used to test the following situation:
    # - A user has created a package (this module).
    # - The user's package consumes another package's API to build an RGF.
    # This kind of situation occurs, for example, when precompiling a package
    # that builds an ODE model function generated by ModelingToolkit.

    using RGFPrecompTest

    # f_bad will NOT work, because it gets put into the RGFPrecompTest's cache
    f_bad = RGFPrecompTest.build_RGF(:((x,y)->x-y))

    # We need to set up a local RGF cache.
    # TODO: Perhaps this should be done automatically inside @RuntimeGeneratedFunctions?
    using RuntimeGeneratedFunctions

    # f_good will work, because it gets put into this module's cache
